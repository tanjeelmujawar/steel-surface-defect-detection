# Automated Steel Surface Defect Detection using CNN & Explainable AI

## Project Overview

This project uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision to automatically detect and classify steel surface defects from industrial images.

The system identifies six defect categories:

* Crazing
* Inclusion
* Patches
* Pitted Surface
* Rolled-in Scale
* Scratches

To improve model transparency, Grad-CAM visualization is used to highlight the image regions responsible for predictions.

## Business Problem

Manual surface inspection in manufacturing is often slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

This project demonstrates how AI-powered visual inspection can help:

* Improve quality control
* Reduce defective products
* Increase inspection speed
* Support explainable decision-making
